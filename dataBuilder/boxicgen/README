This 'package' generated initial conditions for turbulent box simulations in the context of
star formation.

        Partially based on previous work by Andreas Blueler and Elena Gavagnin

To set up the package:
  1) Install MUSIC
  2) Add the simple_turb transfer function to the MUSIC plugins folder
  3) compile the grafic library with 
         f2py -c -m gro graficout.f90
  4) compile the fortran codes 'amr2grafic.f90' and 'degrade_grafic.f90'
     ifort amr2grafic.f90 -o amr2grafic

To generate ICs:
  1) Adapt the parameters in generate_hydro_ic.sh and run the script
  2) Run a hydro-only simulation with the generated ICs
  3) Find the output from where you want to start the gravity run
     (Ekin/2 to have fully developed turbulence)
  4) Adapt the parameters in generate_grav_ic.sh and run the script
  5) You now have turbulent box ICs.
